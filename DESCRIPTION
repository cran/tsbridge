Description: The tsbridge package contains a collection of R functions that can be used to estimate normalising constants using the bridge sampler of Meng and Wong (1996). The functions can be applied to calculate posterior model probabilities for a variety of time series Bayesian models, where parameters are estimated using BUGS, and models themselves are created using the tsbugs package.
